      <h2 class="display-text">Wait… are you actually real?</h2>
      <p class="large-p">
        Sometimes I honestly wonder if you’re real or just something my mind
        made up. Because people like you don’t usually exist — this kind,
        this genuine, this effortlessly beautiful.
        You have this soft presence that makes everything around you feel
        lighter, even on the heaviest days.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block fade-in">
      <h2 class="display-text">The “I’m Sorry” Queen</h2>
      <p>
        You apologize even when it’s not your fault.
        You say sorry when you care too much,
        sorry when you feel too deeply,
        sorry when you’re just being yourself.
        And somehow, that kindness never feels weak —
        it feels rare.
      </p>
      <p class="accent-text">
        “I’m sorry” — something you say often, even when the world should be
        apologizing to you instead.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block fade-in">
      <h2 class="display-text">A Heart That Cares Too Much</h2>
      <p>
        You care in a way that’s pure.
        You listen when others talk,
        you worry when others are hurting,
        and you give without expecting anything back.
        Even when you’re tired, even when you’re hurting,
        you still show up with kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t just care — you *feel*.
        And that makes you incredibly special.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block fade-in">
      <h2 class="display-text">Strong, Even When It Hurt</h2>
      <p>
        You’ve been through things you never talk about.
        You’ve suffered quietly, smiled when it was hard,
        and stayed gentle in a world that wasn’t always gentle to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that’s what makes you strong —
        not loud strength,
        but the kind that survives,
        grows,
        and still chooses kindness.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block fade-in">
      <h2 class="display-text">Talkative, Warm, and Real</h2>
      <p>
        When you talk, there’s warmth in your words.
        Your voice carries comfort.
        You make conversations feel easy,
        laughter feel natural,
        and silence feel safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being around you feels like peace —
        the kind you don’t realize you needed until you have it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block fade-in">
      <h2 class="display-text">A Little Humor, Because You’d Smile</h2>
      <p class="accent-text">
        If kindness had a face, it would probably look like you —
        and still apologize for being too kind.
      </p>
      <p class="accent-text">
        And even when life gets dark, you somehow bring light —
        without even trying.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block fade-in">
  <h2 class="display-text">Okay… I’m Flirting With You</h2>

  <p>
    Honestly, anyone who talks to you for a while
    would end up flirting a little.
    You just have that kind of presence —
    warm, easy, and impossible to ignore.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way you talk,
    the way you smile,
    the way you carry yourself so naturally —
    it pulls people in without you even trying.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yes, that beautiful curve at your waist?
    It’s part of that quiet elegance you have —
    subtle, graceful,
    and effortlessly you.
  </p>

<p class="accent-text">
  So yes… this is flirting.
  Something I chose,
  something I enjoyed,
  and something that felt right in the moment —
  simple,
  happy,
  and genuine.
  And maybe…
  you smiled a little too.
</p>
</div>

  <div class="closing-statement fade-in">
  <h2 class="final-name">Vasu.</h2>
  <p>
    Kind beyond words.
    Strong in ways you don’t always see.
    Beautiful far beyond just looks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please remember —
    you don’t have to carry everything alone.
    It’s okay to feel tired,
    but don’t forget to smile for yourself too.
  </p>
  <p class="accent-text">
    Stay happy.
    Stay soft.
    Stay strong.
    Even on days when your heart feels heavy,
    you are doing better than you think.
